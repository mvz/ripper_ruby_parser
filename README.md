## Hacking and contributing

If you want to send pull requests or patches, please:

* Make sure `rake test` runs without reporting any failures. If your code
  breaks existing stuff, it won't get merged in.
* Add tests for your feature. Otherwise, I can't see if it works or if I
  break it later.
* Make sure latest master merges cleanly with your branch. Things might
  have moved around since you forked.
* Try not to include changes that are irrelevant to your feature in the
  same commit.
